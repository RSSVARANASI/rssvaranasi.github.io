                                                 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
	                                                        
	           
	           Artificial intelligence or Machine intelligence, is an intelligence which is demonstrated by machines unlike human beings.
	           This also include different types of learnings (by machines) which include machine learning.
	           
	           This can be of the following types:
	           
	           1)Supervised learning
	           2)Unsupervised learning
	           3)Reinforcement learning
	           
	           APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING:
	           There are various applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in wide variety of feilds.Some of them are:
	           
	           1)AGRICULTURE:
	           In agriculture machine learning is used in order to perform Precision agriculture (PA), satellite farming or
	           site specific crop management (SSCM) is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring and responding
	           to inter and intra-field variability in crops.
	           
	           2)ANATOMY:
	           Computational anatomy is an interdisciplinary field of biology focused on quantitative investigation and modelling of                     anatomical shapes variability.It involves the development and application of mathematical, statistical and data-analytical               methods for modelling and simulation.
	           
	           3)AFFECTIVE COMPUTING:
	           Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and
	           simulate human affects. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, and cognitive science.
	           
	           4) HANDWRITING RECOGNITION:
	           Handwriting recognition (HWR), also known as Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), is the ability of a computer to 
	           receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, 
	           touch-screens and other devices. The image of the written text may be sensed "off line" from a piece of paper 
	           by optical scanning or intelligent word recognition. Alternatively, the movements of the pen tip may be sensed 
	           "on line", for example by a pen-based computer screen surface, a generally easier task as there are more clues available. 
	           A handwriting recognition system handles formatting, performs correct segmentation into characters, and finds 
	           the most plausible words.
	           
	           5)MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:
	           Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors
	           in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal 
	           of information.
	           
	           6) SEARCH ENGINES:
	           A web search engine or Internet search engine is a software system that is designed to carry out web search, 
	           which means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual
	           web search query.
	           
	           7) SPEECH RECOGNITION:
	           Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and 
	           technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers.            
	           
	           8) ONLINE ADVERTISING:
	           Online advertising, also known as online marketing, Internet advertising, digital advertising or 
	           web advertising, is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages 
	           to consumers.
	           
	           
	           Apart from various applications and advantages, this artificial intelligence has some limitations too.Some of them are:
	           
	           LIMITATIONS:
	           
	           -Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases.
	           
	           -A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new
	             customer groups that are not represented in the training data.
	             
	           - Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.
	           
	           -Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases
	           may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.
	           
	           -Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns 
	           among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as 
	           income-generating machines. 
	           
	           Thus,this concept of artificial intelligence is both a boon and a bane to the society.
